1: Explain the site's purpose:

2: Answer questions you'd think an employer would ask:
### Tell a little about yourself:
- I'm a 19 year old studying in IT, web and game design. I'm experienced in code languages Ruby, JS, HTML, CSS and recently discovered C#. In addition to languages, I'm also adept in the RPG Maker brand, the software series that with combined creativity and logic, one is capable of creating simple as well as advanced and intricit JRPG's with it's subgenre up to the creator. When it comes to HTML5 games I'm the proud co-creator of "Steampunk and Napalm", a short and sweet top-down space shooter written in JS and was a nominated finalist to ITG Sodertorn's award "Guldkretsen 2016".

### What are your strengths and weaknesses?:
- My strengths involve vast creativity with it being a weakness within itself lest it's appropriate and would benefit my work. I can draw, sketch and compose basic tracker songs with software such as Deflemask. I can play guitar too but doubt that'd be that big of a strength.

### What has the highest priority to you during work?:
- To have a balanced working schedule. Too much focus on the task at hand can lead to poor and hasty decisions and likewise results. I believe the workplace should have frequent and scheduled breaks with the length's of which isn't important.

### How do you take criticism?:
- As a plank of wood is to unfinished housing, so is constructive criticism to a project. Such criticism is invaluable and should be taken thankfully. Criticism that doesn't contribute to a problem, a project or an idea all together can one do without unless you can better the critics viewpoint for perhaps more helpful feedback.

### Do you work well in a group or alone? Why?:
- I work well communicating with others, a bit reclusive when a group leader volunteers but can step up and fix a gap if a group is falling apart. I also do well on my own, given some space and a computer or a piece of paper of the very least with being alone being my prefered work style.

3: Shift back and forth imagening from both perspectives:
