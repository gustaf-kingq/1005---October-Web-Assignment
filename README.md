# October-Web-Assignment - Since October 5th

1: Explain the site's purpose:
### Purpose of Site:
- The purpose of this site is for employers to get a clear picture of my person and give info regarding my experiences, talents, skills, abilities, strengths and weaknesses that would garuantee benefit in a company's workplace. For good measure I've also added trivial talents since I consider myself a "jack of all trades, master of none" meaning that I'm educated within IT but that's hardly my strongest skill. Instead, it's having a multitude of various abilities.

2: Answer questions you'd think an employer would ask:
### Tell a little about yourself:
- I'm a swedish 19 year old studying in IT, web and game design. I'm experienced in code languages Ruby, JS, HTML, CSS and recently discovered C#. In addition to languages, I'm also adept in the RPG Maker brand, the software series that with combined creativity, logic and some coding languages for raw input, one is capable of creating simple as well as advanced and intricit JRPG's with it's subgenre being up to the creator. When it comes to HTML5 games I'm the proud co-creator of "Steampunk and Napalm", a short and sweet top-down space shooter written in JS and was a nominated finalist to ITG Sodertorn's award "Guldkretsen 2016".

### What are your strengths and weaknesses?:
- My strengths involve vast creativity with it being a weakness within itself lest it's appropriate and would benefit my work.

- I can draw, sketch and compose basic tracker songs with software such as Deflemask. 

- My programming skills aren't the best since I cannot work unless refering to previous syntax making it a weakness. 

- Working with others on the other hand feels natural as I can present great people skills. Although I'm not the first to step to the plate to lead a project, I would be lending ideas and suggestions as much as anyone and give a voice of reason if a sign of spite shows in the group.

- Fast writer. If I'm in charge of having something written down, It'll be done in a flash as my typing speed is above average, in my own opinion. 

- I can play guitar too but doubt that'd be that big of a strength.

### What has the highest priority to you during work?:
- To have a balanced working schedule. Too much focus on the task at hand can lead to poor and hasty decisions and likewise results. I believe the workplace should have frequent and scheduled breaks with the length's of which isn't important.

### How do you take criticism?:
- As a plank of wood is to unfinished housing, so is constructive criticism to a project. Such criticism is invaluable and should be taken thankfully. Criticism that doesn't contribute to a problem, a project or an idea all together can one do without unless you can better the critics viewpoint for perhaps more helpful feedback.

### Do you work well in a group or alone? Why?:
- I work well communicating with others, a bit reclusive when a group leader volunteers but can step up and fix a gap if a group is falling apart. I also do well on my own, given some space and a computer or a piece of paper of the very least with being alone being my prefered work style.

3: Shift back and forth imagening from both perspectives:
### If I were an employer myself:
- On one hand, having employees following similar attributes to each other would mean a standing dependability with tasks that any employed could accomplish. On the other hand, having a deverse cast of employees with different abilities could develop combinations of their skills and with good morale result in an outstanding cooperation and dependability on each other.

4: Validate a connection between an object model (containing A: a class that will represent a need of something (), B: an usage of the class in reality() and C: the ones who'd benefit from this ()) and 2-3:
- As it will be better viewed from the site itself, I've used five experiences, some more substansial than others with the three properties title, description and period.
