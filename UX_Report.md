## UX - User Experience - 

### Three well-built websites:
##### Steam Powered (http://www.steampowered.com) - The Most Game Related (making it's community that much bigger)
- Steam consists of four navbar categories of use: Store, Community, About and Customer Support while also having their own desktop app for playing games but that's outside the website. Steam in it's entirety has a consistent dark color scheme mostly gray and blue. Their navbars are brimmed with content and directs with precision in the store and has lists of lists of software to purchase with it's system. While the store is focused on dropdowns, the community is centered more around pictures and videos.

##### Newgrounds (http://www.newgrounds.com) - The Prettiest
- With originally just a color scheme of black and orange, Newgrounds today is more vivid than ever. You can watch animations, clips, play flashgames, listen to custom music, watch art or submit your own media all with cool colors wherever you look. It hosts a log in system for accounts and forums as well as submitters and is truly a site for the artistic, even more so than DeviantArt.

##### AllDay (http://www.allday.com) The Most Interesting
- A very modern look without being too up-in-your-face. The home view is beautifully designed and hosts images and news titles the catches the interest of the curious (sounds like any news site) intellectual (that's better). Although a slight overuse of padding can be seen in all news articles, the navbar has categories for any reader, granting they can read, of course. I just accidentally got stuck for a few minutes looking for more to comment. Therefore I dub this sight, for such compliance with it's demographic and usage, The Most Interesting.


### Three poorly-built websites:
##### Yale University School of Art (http://www.art.yale.edu/Home) The Appaling
- With being an educational grounds for art, you'd think some care and effort would go into their website. A lack of this and instead a wave of discomfort with flashing repeated imagery right at the home view with an inconsistent color scheme, unfiltered borderless containers with gradient(ugh) shoved to the left taking up barely 30% of the screen. To top it all off, the navbar is also shoved to the left with home, not being at the top of this navbar but the bottom. No further comment.

##### Penny Juice (http://www.pennyjuice.com/) The Most Childish
- You'd think a childrens site wouldn't have that high standards and requirements and which could easily be met? Apparently, the designers, only answering to Penny Juice, found these too hard and implemented the most utterly basic of RGB colors that stings your eyes more than actually teach about their company selling childrens juice packets. With the benefit of a doubt, they could have used these colors since they pride themselves for having colors that children find fascinating but that's no excuse when your website causes eyestrain from the first to last view. To it's credit, the site does it's one function, it gives details about the company but does it such a basic and childish manner that a business clown couldn't take seriously.

##### Ugly Tub (http://www.uglytub.com) The Most Bare-bones
- With the slightly pinhole perspective (massive body margin and lack of any or at all optimization for larger resolutions) and it's lack of any substansial colors or borders or anything that's appeasing to the eye, Ugly Tub takes the Bare-bones cake. Y'know, the kind of cake that's just water, flour and sugar. It's static animations only does so much as the navbar doesn't exist, there are just a row of links that spill into a second row. Judging from the looks and functionality of their site, Ugly Tubs have no right to call anything else ugly.
